This program is a program that reads data from a file and stores it in an avl tree form. When its run the main menu is printed onto the screen. There are 7 options. First option allows for the user to enter the name of the file 
containing data to be store. Then the file is read and the data is parsed. The second option allows for the user to search for a key withing the avl tree. Third option allows the user to insert a new key into the tree. The fourth
option doen't work as intended. It was never successfully created therefore some information is printed onto the screen making it look like it is working but, its not. Fith option displays the height of the tree and the size of it.
The sixth option serches the tree for keys with a frequency equal or bigger then the one given by the user. The last option ends the program
